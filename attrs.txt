/* Some of these are added from the presentation */


[1] Quality: Community cohesiveness	
	1. Formal Nerworks : 1.1 Membership: countNonTeamCommits, countTeamCommits
	2. Informal community : 2.1 Engagement : average per-month comments / number of active members
	3. Informal network: 3.2 Openness : contributors - collaborators
	3. Informal network: 3.1 Informality : collaboration: following/followers
	3. Informal network: 3.2 Openness : pull requests comments
	4. Network of practice : 4.2 Similarity : 	languages used in repositories to which they contribute
		
	3. Informal network: 3.1 Informality : community members of the same organization represents no more than X of the involved developers	
	


	
[3] Quality: Resilience against fluctuations of community members, how closely community members interact, associativity, measures preference to connect to other community members
	* worked together on files : files changed / which users   ------------------- [[avgUserCollaborationFiles]]
	* are following/followers for each other   ----------------------- [[avgCCFollowers]]
	MembersGraph : Clustering coefficient  ----------------------- [[avgClusteringCoefficient]]
	

[2.1] Quality: Distribution of responsibilities (• measures how responsibilities, collaboration and communication are distributed across community members)
[2.2] Quality: Team characteristics for realizing benefits
	• path length to other node in the network(Closeness centrality)  ------------------------------------ [[closenessCentrality]]
	- number of users that have blogs   ----------------------------------- [[avgBloggers]]
	* 4.6 Average of committers longevity  ---------------------------------------- [[avgCommiterLonvigity]]
	2. Informal community : 2.1 Engagement : subscriptions within the project (watchers) --------------[[avgSubscriptions]]
	
	- team distribution, size, maturity -- NO
	2. Informal community : 2.1 Engagement : numbers of members that are unique commenters -- NO
		
	
[6 - OK] Quality: Task allocation
	- phase-based allocation : commits/milestones [?] - NO
	- points of weakned: issues/milestones [?] - NO
	- commits / user  ---------------  [[avgUserCommits]]
	- files changed / which users   -------------- [[avgFileContributors]]
	4. Network of practice : 4.3 Size : size:active members:those whose total contribution is at least equal to 50%   [[activeMembers - Not sure that I need it]]
	
	
[7 - OK] Quality: Project characteristics  ---> Let's start with this
	- project having a description [Wiki] 	   -----------  [[hasWiki]]
	* 4.9 Evolution in number of events			----------------- [[monthlyEventsStdDev]]
	[CH]* 4.10 Evolution in number of commits --> reopned : reopened : The issue was reopened by the actor.   ---------- [[ReopenedIssuesPercentage]]
	1. Formal Nerworks : 1.2 Formality : calculating the number of milestones assigned to the project   ----------- [[milestonesPerDay]]
	
	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	
[4] Quality: Localization/timeline
	- geographical/temporal distance [+when they commited]
	4. Network of practice : 4.1 Dispersion : members location + distance between them (km)
		
Uncathegorized [?]
- number of issues
