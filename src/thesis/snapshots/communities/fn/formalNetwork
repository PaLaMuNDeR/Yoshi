Formal Network

MEMBERSHIP
Based on what we observed in our sample, the hier-
archy degree is high when the number of permission
groups exceeds 2, or an average of 80% of the users of
the same organization are concentrated within a single
group. Appendix B includes a link to the values of the
metrics we gathered and computed to determine these
levels. 

FORMALITY
In particular, ProjectLibre, which is quite recent, has 0.03 
milestones per day, meaning that, on average, a new milestone 
is created every 33 days. Based on collected results, we can 
state that an organization has a high level of governance if,
on average, at least 0.02 new milestones are created every day.


Before continuing you need to understand the difference between a contributor and a collaborator.

Contributor: A contributor is someone from the outside not on the core development team of the project that wants to contribute some changes to a project.
Collaborator: A collaborator is someone on the core development team of the project and has commit access to the main repository of the project.
