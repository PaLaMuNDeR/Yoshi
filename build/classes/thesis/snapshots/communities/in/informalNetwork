INFORMALITY OF COMMUNICATION
Ties within a community can be considered loose
when the average number of projects to which a couple
of members of the community itself have collaborated
together does not exceed 1
and the maximum percentage of community members of the 
same organization represents no more than 5% of the involved developers

OPENNESS
Another attribute of informal networks is openness. As
explained in Table 7, the metric allowing to understand
the degree of openness of a community is represented
by the level of permissions granted to non-members. 

LACK OF PROJECT GOVERNANCE
an organization has the attribute non-organization when
it has a low number of milestones, namely it has an 
average of no more than 0.02 milestones per day.
