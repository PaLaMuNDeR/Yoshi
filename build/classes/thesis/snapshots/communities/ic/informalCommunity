Given the values included in Appendix B, we found
that engagement within a community is high if, on
average, each member posts no less than 30 comments
per-month. 

Moreover, a member is considered to be a
unique commenter if he or she is responsible for 30%
of contributions or more. In case there are at least a
user and an organization which are unique commenters,
engagement within the community is significant.

The size of a discussion thread is considered high if, on
average, each thread has at least 3.5 comments, or there
are at least 0.1 comments per month for each thread,
on average. 

[?] In our experience, the average number of discussion spread 
from a thread post is high if it exceeds 0.5. In most 
cases, the number of discussion spreads from a thread is 
0 or 1. For what concerns subscriptions, we did not 
have any data allowing us to estimate reliable thresholds.

Beyond engagement, other previously introduced at-
tributes contribute to characterize an informal commu-
nity. These are self-similarity and self-organization (see Sec-
tion 6.1.3). Finally, based on evidence in [36], dispersion is
a pre-condition to the existence of the IC type. Therefore,
a high dispersion , discussed in Section 6.1.3, is necessary
to identify ICs.
